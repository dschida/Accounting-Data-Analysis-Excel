FILTER With a List.xlsx: Filter data using a list of conditions instead of typing a string of conditions. Makes it much easier to build and maintain workbooks using FILTER. Instead of changing all formulas, filter conditions can be updated by modifying lists.

Highlight: Generate arrays of booleans, then collapse into one row / column for use in FILTER.

Show Plan.xlsx: Generate a ranked set of improv games from drop-down list of dates depending on the preferences of actors on stage. Consolidate 2 sets of data. Weight attendance (maybe vs. yes) and preference (like vs. neutral vs. dislike).

Highlight: Apply SUM of dynamic array column-by-column with embedded LAMBDA.
